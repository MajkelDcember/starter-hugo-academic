I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Prior to this, I successfully completed a course in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Oxford at the bachelor's level. I have a strong mathematical background and a keen interest in optimization for machine learning.
