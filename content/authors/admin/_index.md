I am currently a Master’s student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford, specializing in advanced topics such as computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Statistics, also from Oxford, where I ranked in the top 5 of my cohort. My current research endeavors focus on natural language processing, particularly the quantization of large language models. Additionally, I have engaged in reinforcement learning projects and maintain a keen interest in various aspects of generative AI.
